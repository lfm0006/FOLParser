# FOLParser
A parser for first-order logic

FOLParser was developed in Java using ANTLR 4.0. This version is working fine with FOL without quantifiers, although the grammar is prepared to deal with. A test case with 18 propositional formulas was implemented in JUnit, printing in console the formal reasoning using the tableaux method. A graph of the tableaux is generated using dot (Graphviz).
